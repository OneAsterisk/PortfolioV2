          <h2>The Gambler's Descent</h2>
          <p>
            Following my passion of Game Development, me and a group of friends worked together in a class where we were tasked on making a software project togehter of our choosing. For this we chose to work on a roguelite dungeon crawler. We used Unity along with C# to program the game. My role was mainly focused on movement, attacks, and enemy development.

          <h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
          <p>
            I created this personal project as a way for me to further my
            knowledge of HTML and CSS and create an understanding of web hosting
            using Google Firebase and Google Cloud. I am hoping to eventually revamp this to be cooler and more optimized.

          <h2>Blizzard's Climb, HGD</h2>
          <p>
            In Spring 2024 I joined the Husky Game Development enterprise where I worked on a game called Blizard's Climb. I was tasked with designing enemy movement and also working on level collision and design. The game was made in Unity and C#.

          <h2>Internship With Gentex</h2>
          <p>
            I worked with Gentex as a full stack intern from May 2024 - Present. During this time I worked with Typescript, MUI, GraphQL, Rest APIs, and Redux.
            I worked a lot with changing UI elements and also creating a better UX for the user. I utilized GraphQL calls to grab data for the web app.
